## Project Post Mortem

Post mortems are important to understand about what happened in a project and actively think about what you learned.

Post-mortems are meant to be a blame-less space open to objective conversation about what went well and what could be improved.

Even in the examples below, where tens of millions of dollars could be lost, the best approach is to think through the series of events that led to the outcome.

Large mistakes are almost never the fault of the developer, but of the sytems and processes in place to prevent errors and problems.

#### Code and Code Design

1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?

Implement context or redux as state sharing is so important.
Try to use make more reusable components.

Segmenting and naming of my components kept code management easy.

For each, please include code examples.

1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

#### WDI Unit 3 Post Mortem

1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
